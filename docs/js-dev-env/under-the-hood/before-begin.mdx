# Before You Begin

Before you begin check out the sections here.

### Applications in Use

1. FileMaker 19.3 or later
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    - These are already installed on your machine.

### Sign Up for
If you don't already have a github account, please set one up. 
### Install
In order for this environment to work, you need to install a few items.
1. Install the latest LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

### Some Pre-Learning
We're going to be working with `git`, `npm`, and the command line quite a bit in this course. The uses will be simple, but you may want some additional information about each of these.

1. [Git](misc/what-is-git.mdx)
2. [Node](misc/what-is-node.mdx)
3. [Command Line](misc/what-is-cli.mdx)

Again, don't worry. We will walk through all you need to know. However, you can do the following:

1. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt)
2. Check your `npm` and `git` versions.
   -  `npm --version`
   -  `git --version`

See, it's actually pretty easy to work with the command line. 

### Onward
Now, let's actually grab and set up the environment.
