# Quickstart


## Before You Begin

Before you begin check out the sections here.

### Applications in Use

1. FileMaker 19.3 or later
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    - These are already installed on your machine.

### Sign Up for
If you don't already have a github account, please set one up. 
### Install
In order for this environment to work, you need to install a few items.
1. Install the latest LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

### Some Pre-Learning
We're going to be working with `git`, `npm`, and the command line quite a bit in this course. The uses will be simple, but you may want some additional information about each of these.

1. [Git](misc/what-is-git.mdx)
2. [Node](misc/what-is-node.mdx)
3. [Command Line](misc/what-is-cli.mdx)

Again, don't worry. We will walk through all you need to know. However, you can do the following:

1. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt)
2. Check your `npm` and `git` versions.
   -  `npm --version`
   -  `git --version`

See, it's actually pretty easy to work with the command line. 
## Grab the JS Dev Environment

Next, let's get the [repository](misc/what-is-repo.mdx) from which we'll make our development environment.

Here's how to do this:

1. Go to the environment's repository link.
2. Click on the "Use This Template" button.
    - This process will ask you to save the repository to your own Github account. Fill in the relevant information (see [here](misc/what-is-repo.mdx) for more details), and then let the process work.

First, fill out the information here. There's no spaces in a repo, name, so use camel case or hypens (I prefer the latter for repo names).

Let that process run after clicking the green button at the bottom. Once you do that, you'll be presented with this repository on your GitHub account.

Next, we need to clone the repository. That is, we need to get all the code down from GitHub to your local machine will keeping a link between the local and remote. To do that, click on the "Code" button and click the clipboard icon. This step

## Start up the development server
