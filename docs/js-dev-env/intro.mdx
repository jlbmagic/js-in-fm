# Introducing the JavaScript Development Environment

Develop || Render || Deploy

This environment allows you to start coding your widget and see the results right away in a FileMaker file. Once done developing, code is inlined and pushed to the FileMaker file for use offline.
It's a template file, so you can use to start other projects.
