# Using JS in FM

Welcome to the first ever JavaScript in FileMaker site, a place devoted specifically to how and what a FileMaker developer can use JS to build awesome widgets that interact completely with the app's data.

Check out these modules. All the information, the steps and guides, on how to do work with JS in FileMaker are found in the sections below.

## JS Learning Path

There's a lot to know about JavaScript, and we FileMaker developers might not have all that time, and the scope of learning seems a bit overwhelming. But fear not, we've put together a nice learning path that describes what you can learn in JS to get you working with it quickly in FileMaker (preferabbly in the JS Dev Environment :))

Behold, the learning path. Yes, it's small. Don't worry, the documentation provides a larger view with many more details.

## JS Dev Environment

The JavaScript Development Environment is the place to develop, render, and deploy JavaScript widgets. Here you'll be able to see what your widget looks like inside FileMaker and see how it interacts with the data.
