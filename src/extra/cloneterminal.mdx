## Clone to Your Machine with Terminal

Next, we need to clone the repository. That is, we need to get all the code down from GitHub to your local machine will keeping a link between the local and remote. To do that, click on the "Code" button and click the clipboard icon. We'll use that copied URL in the next section.

Let's do some work now in Terminal (keeping that copied URL in mind).

Here's what to do:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Change Directory into a folder where you want this environment to be located. All of the files in that repository will be put into this place.
   - I've got all my repostories stored in a folder called "JSWork" inside my Documents folder, so the path to the directory looks like this:
     `cd /users/jeremybrown/documents/jswork`
3. Now that terminal is in that directory, type `git clone` + space, and then paste the repository URL.
   - Here's what my line looks like:
     - `git clone https://github.com/jlbmagic/this-is-my-environment.git`
   - This will clone the repository from the remote on GitHub to your local machine in that directory.
   - If this is the first time ever using Git, then you might have to install some git tools.
     - You might see a message that looks like this:
       - `The "git" command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install.."`
       - If that's the case, let it happen.
     - It might take 10 minutes or so.
     - When this finishes, run the `git clone` command again.

And here is the repsitory on my machine.
