There's a lot that we can do with JavaScript in FileMaker. Of course it comes down to the uses cases that you need to solve, but we have a lot of options.

This sections speaks on what we can do with the langauge in FileMaker. We don't cover any technical stuff here; it's more of an inspiring kind of documentation :)

## Upcoming Content

In this section we'll discuss the following topics:

1. How to work with JavaScript Libraries
2. How to use vanilla JavaScript to create something of our own.
3. Use case examples to get your brain flowing with what use cases you have that could be solved with JS.
4. Using the web viewer as a calc engine.

These topics cover pretty much the breadth of our use of JavaSCript in FileMaker. Check back for more information.
