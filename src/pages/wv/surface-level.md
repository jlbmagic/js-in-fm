## What is the Web Viewer?
The Web Viewer is a FileMaker object that can display web content. It can be used to display web pages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can also be used to display data from FileMaker, and to interact with FileMaker scripts.

The web viewer can display any content that is an HTML file, or that can be rendered as HTML. This includes web pages, HTML files, and JavaScript libraries. In our world, this also includes the data from a container field.
