## Features
### Code from anywhere
The web viewer is an object we can set via a script. It is also a calculation engine. So we can get the code from anywhere using diverse methods.

#### Storing the code
We can store the code in a field in a table. Stored in this manner, the HTML is accessible from anywhere in the app. 

We can also store the code in an extenral host. This requires us to have a process by which we get the code we write up to the host, but once it is there, a URL is all we need to access it.
#### Accessing the code
If the code is stored in a field, we can use any number of FileMaker techniques to grab the code and set it into the web viewer. One approach is a script that, among other things, gets the code from the table, sets it into a variable, and then places into the web viewer. '
